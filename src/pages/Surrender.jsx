    <p className='text-center'>We are sorry that a hardship is forcing you to lose a family member. <br /> Pets are living beings with emotions just like us, and it is hard for an <br /> owner and a pet to separate. We thank you for trusting us when you <br /> surrender your pet to Big Easy Animal Rescue! We know it is tough, and <br /> we are here to do our best to assist you in finding a forever home for <br /> your family member. <br />
    Our rescue is foster-based, so we can not take in every dog or cat that <br /> is submitted due to space constraints. As such, processing a <br />surrender application can take a while, as we need to find an available <br /> foster. We thank you for your patience.  <br /><br /><br />

       <b>All applicants must be 23 years of age or older.</b></p>
